# Positive-Quote-Generator
Feeling down? This program will tell you an encouraging quote to get you through the day.


## How It's Made:

**Concepts used:**  arrays, If Statements, Scanner, Random class

### Quote Generator
An array full of quotes is made at the start of the program. When the user requests a quote a random index is generated. The quote at that index is then printed.




### User Interaction
The user is asked if they'd like a quote. Their response is stored in a scanner. If the string that scanner stores is "yes" a daily quote printed.

## Lessons Learned:
Random Class & Arrays are simple but powerful
 This was my first time combining the random class with Arrays. Just from using this program I can think of lots of cool uses for random Arrays. Pretty much any  simple probability based game could be theoretically implemented via random indexes.
